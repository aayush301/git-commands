Main function: Switch branches or restore working tree files.

git checkout <branch>
		// HEAD now points to <branch>. Local modifications to the files in the working tree are kept, so that they can be committed to the <branch>.

git checkout -b <new_branch>
		// It causes a new branch to be created and then checked out, if it doesn't exist.
		// If it exists, then error occurs.

git checkout -B <new_branch>
		// <new_branch> is created if it doesnâ€™t exist; otherwise, it is reset.
		// Eq. of: git branch -f <branch>; git checkout <branch>;

git checkout <commit>
		// Head gets detached to commit
