Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository.
Staged files are added into staging index.
The "staging index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working directory,
	and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit.
	Thus after making any changes to the working directory, and before running the commit command,
	you must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index.



git add file.txt						// To stage a file
git add --all  OR  git add -A			// To stage all files
git add -i  OR  git add --interactive	// Add modified contents in the working tree interactively to the staging index.
