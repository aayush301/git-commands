Commit creates a checkpoint in repository.
We should always include a message when we commit.

git commit -m "updated files"

git commit -a -m "updated files"
	// -a will tell the command to automatically stage and then commit files that have been
	// modified and deleted in working tree (by doing git add and git rm and then commit),
	// but new files you have not told Git about are not affected.
